# go-algorithms
This is a collection of algorithms and data-structure implemenetations in Go made by myself!

## How this works
I work with a TDD methodology. Each folder has its [name].go file and its [name]_test.go file. In order to run the go code just go to the desired path and run the following command:
```bash
go test [-v] // The -v flag is optional
```
